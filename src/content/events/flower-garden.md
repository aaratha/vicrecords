With the end of the year fast approaching, everyone is being hit with a lot between finals and exams. To help with that, we have put together a nice, calming playlist designed to make you feel like you’re sitting in a flower garden painted by a 19th-century impressionist artist. Relax, and enjoy the groundbreaking effect that florals can have for your spring-season stress!!

We also want to thank you for another amazing year for Vic Records! It was so nice to be able to engage with you all online and in person. We can’t wait to get our exec positions filled and get planning for next year!!

All the best for a fantastic summer,

From everyone at Vic Records
