Dear Vic Records Community,

First off, huge thanks for sticking around! We have been quiet with our blog posts for a bit, but trust that it was all for a good cause! We have been giving our website a total makeover and cannot wait for you to check out the new features. It's live, it's fresh, and it's all for you!

Now, onto the super exciting stuff â€“ this Friday, March 8th, we are throwing an event that's going to rock your socks off. In celebration of International Women's Day, we will be doing a music video screening that pays homage to the iconic women of rock. These are the trailblazers who have sculpted rock into the powerhouse genre it is today. But wait, there's more! After we watch the awesome group of music videos, we will be having some awesome live performances that you won't want to miss.

All the details and how you can attend are waiting for you on our Instagram @vicrecords. Make sure to check it out, sign up and bring all your friends!

And because we cannot contain our excitement, we have already dropped a playlist on Spotify! It is a tribute to the women who've been making waves in rock. Plug in, turn up the volume, and let's get in the mood for Friday :raised_hands:

Rock on,

Artin
