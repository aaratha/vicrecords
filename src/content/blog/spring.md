Happy Spring! (kind of) We are so happy that the weather is starting to change a bit, bringing all of the lovely elements of spring along. To celebrate this wonderful change in seasons we have put together a playlist to welcome this new season! We all contributed songs that we felt reminded us of spring in some way, which resulted in a fun collection of songs that we hope you enjoy!



Spring also means that exams and finals are fast approaching, but we will continue to produce lots of fun stuff for you all! Music is one of the best things to keep around this time of year (in our opinion), as there is always something that can capture how you’re feeling and make your day a bit better. Have a look through our spotify profile to find what you’re looking for, or let us know if there is a playlist that you would like us to make!



Happy spring!



Gabrielle + Celia
