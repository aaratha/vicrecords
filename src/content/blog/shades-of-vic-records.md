Dear Reader,



At Vic Records, we believe that music unites souls and tells stories beyond words. We are thrilled to unveil our brand-new playlist, “shades of vic records," a playlist curated by our executive team, containing 10 carefully chosen tracks from each member. We hope you get to know us better through seeing which songs each member chose!



But that’s not all! Visit our Instagram account (@vicrecords) to catch a series of stories from all the executives explaining why a specific song holds a special place in their heart.



And here's an exciting announcement! We invite you to join us for an unforgettable evening of music and talent at our Open Mic Night on October 3rd at the Cat's Eye. It’s a chance for budding artists and music lovers alike to come together and share their passions. For more details on the Open Mic Night, visit our Instagram!



So, mark your calendars, follow us on Instagram, and give a listen to this month’s playlist.



Hope everyone has a peaceful beginning to their October



\- Artin Khiabani
